Hi, Greetings and Regards I first tried to understand the overall structure of the program by reading the API document. Then I started building the program. I analyzed the performance of the program step by step. I used the following frameworks on your recommendation:

● React ● Bootstrap ● npm

In the end, I put all my efforts into the efficiency and quality of the program to provide the desired output. After a relatively long time and receiving errors, I noticed that the existing API photos did not work properly and were apparently removed from the API. In my opinion, the construction and testing of this program does not take more than 4 to 5 hours, but due to technical testing and improving the quality of work, it exceeded the expected time. I hope it has attracted your attention. Thanks & Regards , Mohammad Asadi
